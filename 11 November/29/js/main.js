// The objective of Duck, duck, goose is to walk in a circle, tapping on each player's head until one is chosen.

// Task: Given an array of Player objects (an array of associative arrays in PHP) and an index 
// (1-based), return the name of the chosen Player(name is a property of Player objects, e.g Player.name)

// Example:

// duck_duck_goose([a, b, c, d], 1) should return a.name
// duck_duck_goose([a, b, c, d], 5) should return a.name
// duck_duck_goose([a, b, c, d], 4) should return d.name

  while(goose > players.length){
    console.log(goose)
    console.log(players.length)
    goose-= players.length
  }

  return players[goose-1].name
}

class Player {
  constructor(name) {
  	this.name = name;
  }
